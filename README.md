# SIMULATED VOTE VIEWER
---   
## Abstract   
This is a simple application made to learn React and ExpressJS. The idea is that the back-end simulates a vote between 3 progressive rock drummers ( -_-) using a simple randomization algorithm. In addition to the vote simulation, there is also a popularity simulation occurring at the same time. The front-end part of the application is to visualize the votes and popularity count.

## A little more about it

### Motivation
This is a simple application made to learn a little bit about React and to practice front-end and back-end in general.

### Ingredients
This front-end part of the application uses the yarn package manager and the main dependency is materialize-css. The back-end is made using expressJS

### How to run in development mode
First of all, install the front-end and back-end modules using yarn. To do this simple run `yarn` in the front-end root folder and in the back-end root folder. Everything is supposed to run well and everyone will be happy. The next step is to serve the backend by running `node index.js` in the back-end folder and starting the front-end executing `yarn start` in the front-end folder and the application will start and run in localhost in the port 3000. So Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### That's it?   
Yep! That's it! Super simple.
